## My Development Workflow

### Branches

- Master - The Master Branch only contained working code
- Original - Contains the basic working map before I started customizing
- All other branches - I do a new branch for each fix/enhancement

## Project ToDo List: See [Project Board](https://github.com/wilsongis/nuxt-mapper/projects/1)
